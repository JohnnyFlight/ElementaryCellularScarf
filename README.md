# ElementaryCellularScarf
Small Python Script for creating knitting patterns based on elementary cellular automatons.

The script currently expects the parameters in a specific order, and output as .PNG file.

1: The rule number to use, between 0 and 255
2: The number of times to perform the rules (ie. the number of rows in the image)
3: The string value to use as the starting value. The resulting image will always have 8 * (number of characters) columns.
